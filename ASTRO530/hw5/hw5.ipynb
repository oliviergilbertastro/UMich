    "Something interesting I learned from this lecture is that disks around a very inclined planet can be disturbed to the point where they are locally warped, and even orthogonal compared to the rest of the disk. I also knew that we used infrared observations to observe scattered starlight to infer the structure of the disk, but I learned that one of the reason for this is because that scattered light can be observed at a much higher resolution than optical, and even radio light. Alycia Weinberger mentions the resolution of tens of milliarcseconds that is now possible in the infrared is even higher than ALMA's resolution.\n",

    "Another thing I learned is that the excess of far-IR emission observed that is usually attributed to the dust can actually be caused by the star sometimes. In resolved images, we can see the star has an excess that was found to be caused by stellar flares, not its blackbody continuum."
